            <h4>Lego’s new botanical collection: Five other sets to buy if you want to get building now.</h4>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">As part of its creator collection, toy giant Lego has launched two brand-new sets with a botanical theme: a flower bouquet and a bonsai tree.
                Costing £44.99 each, the sets are available to pre-order now on the Lego website, ready to be dispatched by 8 February 2021, with one allowed per customer.
                Both have been designed with adult Lego enthusiasts in mind: they are for those over 18 years old and have 756 and 878 pieces in the flower and bonsai sets respectively.
                You can trust our independent round-ups. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice. This revenue helps us to fund journalism across The Independent.And several elements from these sets are made from a plant-based plastic, produced using sustainably sourced sugarcane.
                During another national lockdown, we reckon a few Lego boxes could come in handy for those quiet weekends in. If you’re keen to get stuck in but can’t wait to get your hands on the new sets, don’t worry as our reviewers have put plenty more Lego to the test.Here we’ve included the best sets for kids of varying ages rather than specifically for adults, but this means they can be a great bonding activity for all the family.And if you’re an adult who’s brand new to Lego, you could also try one of these sets on your own to get a feel for it before moving on to bigger, botanical projects.
                There are also some kits for younger children, too. Ready? Steady? Build!It includes minifigures of the film’s main characters – Emmet, Lucy and Rex Dangervest – so recipients can reenact key scenes to their hearts’ content. There are pleasing details, like the spring-loaded shooters for the rocket.
                Testing for the best gifts for eight year olds, our reviewer said that this two-in-one set had “enough fiddly bits to keep most eight year olds happy”, but also noted that “some super-keen builders might find it a little straightforward in parts”. Though we think that’s a plus point for Lego newbies, whatever their age.
                If you’ve got a Star Wars fan in the house, Luke Skywalker's X-Wing Fighter Toy (£45, Argos) will surely get their imagination going.

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">A commission to tackle air pollution in the National Capital Region will have to shut down only five months after it was formed because the ordinance that set it up has lapsed.“The commission will cease to function but it is not as if the issue of air pollution will go unaddressed,” environment secretary RP Gupta told ET. “Institutions such as the Central Pollution Control Board, the state pollution control boards and state governments of Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, and the ministry of environment will continue to deal with issues relating to monitoring and management of air quality.”The move came within days of the government indicating to the Supreme Court that it was considering an institutional measure to address air pollution in the NCR.
